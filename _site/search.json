The book is a dense, esoteric tome on meta-mathematics, paradoxes, and how they relate to the nature of thought itself. It’s certainly not light reading, but I’ve always had an aspiration read it cover to cover.\nHowever, a puzzle introduced early in the book has always captured by imagination.\n\n\n\n Back to top"
