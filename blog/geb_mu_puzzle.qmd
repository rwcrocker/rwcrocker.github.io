MU, MIU, MIUIU, MIUIUIUIU, ...

If you've ever found yourself scratching these hieroglyphs into the margins of a paperback, you've likely encountered the MU Puzzle. It's a puzzle, or maybe more of a lesson, from the book GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid by Douglas Hofstadter. The book is a dense, esoteric tome on meta-mathematics, paradoxes, and how they relate to the nature of thought itself. It's certainly not light reading, but I've always had an aspiration read it cover to cover.

However, a puzzle introduced early in the book has always captured by imagination.
