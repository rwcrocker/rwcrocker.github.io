## Summary
I earned my Bachelor of Arts in Biology from Kenyon College in May 2020, gaining a strong foundation in scientific inquiry and problem solving.

## Institution
[Kenyon College](https://www.kenyon.edu/) is a liberal arts institution in Gambier, Ohio, known for rigorous academics, independent research, and emphasis on interdisciplinary learning. 

## Impact
Kenyon fostered my curiosity and honed my critical thinking, research, and communication skills—qualities that continue to guide me today. Studying Biology gave me a strong grounding in data-driven reasoning, whether it was designing experiments, analyzing results, or interpreting patterns. The interdisciplinary nature of my liberal arts education encouraged me to explore connections between seemingly unrelated fields, which now helps me bridge gaps between technical and business needs.

Kenyon’s emphasis on writing and communication also shaped my ability to present complex ideas in a way that is accessible and actionable. Whether I’m collaborating with stakeholders or building scalable solutions, the habits I developed at Kenyon are at the core of how I approach my work today.
