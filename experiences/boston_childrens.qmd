## Summary
For two years, I worked as a Research Assistant in the Vascular Biology lab of Dr. Timothy Hla at Boston Children's Hospital.

## Institution

[Boston Children's Hospital](https://www.childrenshospital.org/) is a leading pediatric medical center known for its groundbreaking research and innovation. The hospital's partnership with [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/) fosters a dynamic and collaborative scientific environment for discovery and clinical innovation.

# Responsibilities

As a Research Assistant, my responsibilities in the lab included both wet-work and bioinformatics analysis. However, I quickly evolved into the lab's primary bioinformatics specialist and spent the majority of my time generating, cleaning, and analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data in models of vascular pathogenesis.
